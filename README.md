# SnakeGame
1. Fun, small Snake project I made over the weekend to get a better understanding of threads and processes.
2. Launch the game using `SnakeGame game{9}` to create a 9x9 grid to play on. You could, of course, modify the grid's size by the same logic. Grid sizes are limited to 255, and I would not recommend any size larger than 17 per point #3.
3. Visuals are not amazing as I focused purely on the algorithm and did not have enough time to incorporate Windows API. Perhaps in a future update if I were to come back to this project.
